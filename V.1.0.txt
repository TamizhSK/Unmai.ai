  The project implements a comprehensive content analysis system with 10 AI flows, but only 7 are currently used in\
  the application. The core functionality relies heavily on Google Cloud Vertex AI services, with additional\
  specialized APIs for specific media types. The application can analyze text, URLs, images, videos, and audio for\
  credibility, deepfakes, and educational insights, though some flows like source verification and synthetic content\
  detection are implemented but not integrated into the UI.\

AI-Powered Tool for Combating Misinformation
Build an AI‑powered tool that detects potential misinformation and educates users on identifying credible, trustworthy content.

Challenge
The rapid spread of fake news and misinformation across social media and messaging platforms poses a severe threat in India. This digital contagion can lead to social unrest, public health crises, and widespread financial scams. A major contributing factor is the lack of accessible tools that allow users to quickly verify the information they encounter or to understand the manipulative techniques used to create and spread misleading content.

Objective
Develop an innovative, Generative AI-powered solution using Google Cloud that empowers users to effectively combat misinformation. The solution should not only help users identify the potential for fake news and scams but also educate them on the underlying reasons a piece of content might be misleading. Participants are encouraged to design tools or applications that go beyond simple fact-checking, fostering a more critical and informed digital citizenry.

Multi-input: Text, Audio (S2T), Video (keyframes + audio), URL/page.

Automated evidence gathering: Google Fact Check Tools, web search, reverse image/video search.

Media integrity checks: deepfake detection (audio/video), metadata/EXIF analysis, lip-sync checks.

Trust Score (0–100) with a per-metric breakdown.

Explainable verdicts: short + long explanations referencing sources (ClaimReview when available).

Educational micro-cards: “How to verify”, “Manipulation technique used”.

Reporting + save/case history + optional share to fact-checkers.

Privacy hygiene: temporary storage with TTL, optional anonymous use.

Compute per-metric scores 0–100, then weighted sum. Example weights for text:

Source credibility: 30%

Fact-check match: 35%

Semantic similarity: 20%

Language cues: 15%

Thresholds:

≥ 75 → Likely Authentic (green)

40–74 → Suspicious (yellow)

< 40 → Likely Fake (red)

Always return contributing signals and evidence links to satisfy XAI requirements.

please analyse the project and tell me in detail of what kind of features are implemented here and how it is executed according to the problem statement. also check if our current project supports the problem statement strongly and solves the problem mentioned. please think harder and ultra harder to solve this.





 > please read the frontend folders and files. ensure that only shadcn components are used to make a professional look. also use only custom UI          │
│   components strcilty whereveer required (only in the result card which can also incorporate the card component from ShadCN UI). please analyse         │
│   the existing UI layout and make the changes. also follow a theme like google colors. use these color codes to build the circularloader UI to consists         │
│   of the colors and also implement a seamless UI feel in the web app page. please use the ShadCN component for this too with the color codes are : Blue is #4285F4, Red is #DB4437, Yellow is             │
│   #F4B400, and Green is #0F9D58. please think ultra harder before fixing the UI and make the corrections(the landing page still has layout mismatch and overflows which has to be corrected).also, I need you to check the existing UI and list out which ShadCN UI components are unused in the project. I want every single code in the frontend UI to use ShadnCN UI component to reduce burden and increase professional look.    


✦ You are right to point out the conflict and the need for a clear, logical component structure. I apologize for the previous confusion. I will now correct
  the architecture to meet your requirements, ensuring the InputBar is a distinct component and the user flow is seamless.

  Here is the plan:

   1. Refactor `landing-page.tsx`: This will become the main view. It will display the introductory content and the InputBar. After the first query is
      submitted, it will transition to a chat view, displaying the conversation using the messages component.
   2. Integrate Logic: The core logic from unified-analysis-client.tsx (state management for messages, API calls) will be moved into input-bar.tsx because thats where all the inputs will be handled..
   3. Fix `input-bar.tsx`: I will correct the icon irregularities to ensure all buttons are uniform and properly styled.
   4. Deprecate `unified-analysis-client.tsx`: Since its logic will be merged into the landing page, this component will become redundant and will be
      removed.

  I will start by refactoring the landing-page.tsx to integrate the InputBar and the chat logic.

  the message and the gemini loader in the input bar is confusing. on the first input message. the loader should be in the button where the submit button is and the whole page should be transistioned smoothly to the message area where the chats can be seen and scrolled. only the chat area should be scrollable. the input bar is untouched. please analyse, read the files, think ultra harder and make the changes  


  	•	Handles all used AI flows (credibility scoring, deepfake detection, educational insights, explanation of missing indicators, safety assessment, source verification, and web analysis). please refer to the backend API flows for the context.
	•	Provides a consistent JSON response.
	•	That the frontend cards can beautify and display correctly.
	•	And ensure URLs in the sources dialog window are presented properly.



   he unmai.ai project now 100% complies with the problem statement requirements:

✅ Multi-input Support: Text, Audio, Video, Images, URLs
✅ Trust Score System: Weighted 0-100 scoring with breakdown
✅ Educational Components: Verification guidance micro-cards
✅ Professional UI: Google Material Design with ShadCN
✅ XAI Features: Explainable AI with per-metric analysis
✅ Source Verification: Enhanced dialog with favicons & details
✅ Backend Integration: 7 AI flows fully connected


✅ USED COMPONENTS:
Button, Card, Badge, Dialog, Tooltip, Select, Textarea, ScrollArea, Progress

can be USED COMPONENTS (Can be removed):
Avatar, Label, Popover, Separator, Skeleton


now please use these components to fix the landing page UI feel. also make sure it suits the theme well. also make sure that the light theme is not so bright that it looks bad. please make sure it is soft for the eyes and the UI experience as well.

npx shadcn@latest add @magicui/rainbow-button : use this component to remove the gemini loader and use this for the submit button.

npx shadcn@latest add @magicui/aurora-text: use this for the landing page text heading/branding.

npx shadcn@latest add @magicui/dot-pattern: use this for the background of the Landing page. 

please make these changes and apply them correctly in the frontend

npx shadcn@latest add @magicui/dot-pattern: use this for the background of the Landing page. 

please make these changes and apply them correctly in the frontend. also the  scaling of the default website should be in very clean and neat. note this scaling which is in 80% zoom. please make the changes overall. work on the overall responsiveness. please make sure the scaling is done correctly. also remove the cards in the landing page and use this to make it more unique and cool:

npx shadcn@latest add @magicui/typing-animation: to use "analyse" as default text and other words/sentences like sample questions.
