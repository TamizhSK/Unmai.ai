AI Flows Analysis\
\
  Used AI Flows (7 flows)\
   1. get-credibility-score.ts - Used in unified-analysis-client.tsx for analyzing text and URL content credibility\
   2. detect-deepfake.ts - Used in unified-analysis-client.tsx for analyzing images, videos, and audio for deepfakes\
   3. provide-educational-insights.ts - Used in unified-analysis-client.tsx for providing educational insights\
   4. explain-misleading-indicators.ts - Used in indicator-explanation.tsx component to explain why content might be\
      misleading\
   5. safety-assessment.ts - Defined but not imported/used anywhere in the codebase\
   6. verify-source.ts - Defined but not imported/used anywhere in the codebase\
   7. perform-web-analysis.ts - Defined but not imported/used anywhere in the codebase\
\
  Unused AI Flows (3 flows)\
   1. detect-synthetic-content.ts - Defined but not imported/used anywhere in the codebase\
   2. analyze-content-for-misinformation.ts - Defined but not imported/used anywhere in the codebase\
\
  Method of Response/Output Generation\
\
  Each flow follows a similar pattern:\
   1. Input validation using Zod schemas\
   2. Prompt engineering with specific instructions to the AI model\
   3. AI model invocation using Google Vertex AI (Gemini models)\
   4. Response parsing and validation using Zod schemas\
   5. Error handling with fallback responses\
\
  The flows generate output in JSON format as specified by their respective Zod schemas, with the AI models being\
  instructed to return responses in specific JSON structures.\
\
  Google Cloud Services Used\
\
  Based on the dependencies in package.json and code implementation:\
\
   1. Google Cloud Vertex AI (@google-cloud/vertexai)\
      - Used for: Gemini 2.5 Pro model for text and image analysis\
      - Files: genkit.ts, all AI flows\
      - Services:\
        - Text generation model (gemini-2.5-pro)\
        - Vision model (gemini-2.5-pro)\
        - Grounded model with web search retrieval capabilities\
\
   2. Google Cloud Vision API (@google-cloud/vision)\
      - Used for: Safe search detection in images\
      - File: detect-deepfake.ts\
      - Services:\
        - SafeSearchDetection for identifying adult, medical, spoof, violence, and racy content\
\
   3. Google Cloud Video Intelligence API (@google-cloud/video-intelligence)\
      - Used for: Video analysis (placeholder implementation)\
      - File: detect-deepfake.ts\
      - Services:\
        - Face detection\
        - Shot change detection\
        - Label detection\
\
   4. Firebase (firebase)\
      - Listed in dependencies but not used in any of the AI flows or components\
      - Potentially for future implementation\
\
  Where Each Service is Used\
\
   1. Vertex AI:\
      - genkit.ts: Configuration and initialization of models\
      - get-credibility-score.ts: Text and image analysis\
      - provide-educational-insights.ts: Educational insights generation\
      - explain-misleading-indicators.ts: Explanation of misleading content\
      - detect-deepfake.ts: Image analysis with Gemini Vision model\
      - safety-assessment.ts: Content safety evaluation\
      - verify-source.ts: Source verification with web grounding\
      - perform-web-analysis.ts: Real-time web analysis\
      - analyze-content-for-misinformation.ts: Misinformation analysis\
\
   2. Vision API:\
      - detect-deepfake.ts: Safe search detection for images\
\
   3. Video Intelligence API:\
      - detect-deepfake.ts: Video analysis (placeholder implementation)\
\
   4. Firebase:\
      - Not currently used in any flows\
\
  Summary\
\
  The project implements a comprehensive content analysis system with 10 AI flows, but only 7 are currently used in\
  the application. The core functionality relies heavily on Google Cloud Vertex AI services, with additional\
  specialized APIs for specific media types. The application can analyze text, URLs, images, videos, and audio for\
  credibility, deepfakes, and educational insights, though some flows like source verification and synthetic content\
  detection are implemented but not integrated into the UI.\

So far so good!!!!!!!
