\
  Summary\
\
  The project implements a comprehensive content analysis system with 10 AI flows, but only 7 are currently used in\
  the application. The core functionality relies heavily on Google Cloud Vertex AI services, with additional\
  specialized APIs for specific media types. The application can analyze text, URLs, images, videos, and audio for\
  credibility, deepfakes, and educational insights, though some flows like source verification and synthetic content\
  detection are implemented but not integrated into the UI.\

So far so good!!!!!!!

AI-Powered Tool for Combating Misinformation
Build an AI‑powered tool that detects potential misinformation and educates users on identifying credible, trustworthy content.

Challenge
The rapid spread of fake news and misinformation across social media and messaging platforms poses a severe threat in India. This digital contagion can lead to social unrest, public health crises, and widespread financial scams. A major contributing factor is the lack of accessible tools that allow users to quickly verify the information they encounter or to understand the manipulative techniques used to create and spread misleading content.

Objective
Develop an innovative, Generative AI-powered solution using Google Cloud that empowers users to effectively combat misinformation. The solution should not only help users identify the potential for fake news and scams but also educate them on the underlying reasons a piece of content might be misleading. Participants are encouraged to design tools or applications that go beyond simple fact-checking, fostering a more critical and informed digital citizenry.

Multi-input: Text, Audio (S2T), Video (keyframes + audio), URL/page.

Automated evidence gathering: Google Fact Check Tools, web search, reverse image/video search.

Media integrity checks: deepfake detection (audio/video), metadata/EXIF analysis, lip-sync checks.

Trust Score (0–100) with a per-metric breakdown.

Explainable verdicts: short + long explanations referencing sources (ClaimReview when available).

Educational micro-cards: “How to verify”, “Manipulation technique used”.

Reporting + save/case history + optional share to fact-checkers.

Privacy hygiene: temporary storage with TTL, optional anonymous use.

Compute per-metric scores 0–100, then weighted sum. Example weights for text:

Source credibility: 30%

Fact-check match: 35%

Semantic similarity: 20%

Language cues: 15%

Thresholds:

≥ 75 → Likely Authentic (green)

40–74 → Suspicious (yellow)

< 40 → Likely Fake (red)

Always return contributing signals and evidence links to satisfy XAI requirements.
